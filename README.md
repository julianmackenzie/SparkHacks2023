# SparkHacks2023
This project was created for the SparkHacks 2023 Hackathon @ UIC by myself, John Hillebrand, and Rafael Sanchez.

It won second place in its category!

It is a small event finder, for individuals to advertise street performances, art events, small concerts, and food events.
It was built in 24 hours for the SparkHacks 2023 Hackathon, under the theme of "Community Resilience."

Executing "App.java" should allow the user to see what we've created.
